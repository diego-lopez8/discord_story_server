# discord_story_server

This repository contains a prototype for presenting a story through interactive chat bots on a discord server. 

I'm not sure if this will even work, but this is vaguely trying to emulate the magic of the "Choose your own adventure" goosebumps stories I used to read as a kid. But using chatbots and dynamically opening and closing channels and chatbots to advance a story.
